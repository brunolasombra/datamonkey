# Installation

To install DataMonkey you need use the [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) package manager and add the following lines
to your *composer.json* file:

```
{
    "require": {
        "devsdmf/datamonkey": "~1.0.0"
    }
}
```

*Don't worry, the Doctrine DBAL is included in the package.*
